# Learning FROST from the Command Line 0.0
### _by Christopher Allen and Shannon Appelcline_

![](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/projects/lbtc-screen.png)

Learning FROST from the Command Line is a tutorial that explains the
basic of FROST and other Schnorr-based signature systems. It then uses
hands on command-line tools to offer real examples of how to use FROST
for general signing and specifically for signing Bitcoin transactions.

> NOTE: This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback
from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for use.

_This tutorial assumes that you have some minimal background of how to
use the command line interface. If not, there are many tutorials
available, and I have one for Mac users at
https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line._
