# Chapter Four: FROST and Bitcoin

FROST has a lot of potential use cases involving cooperative action
and management: members of a FROST group can jointly make decisions in
an irrevocable way. Group governance and organizational
decision-making could both benefit.

However, another use case is likely to have even more immediate usage:
controlling digital assets, in particular Bitcoin. Because the most
mature toolset to date is focused on Zcash, working with Bitcoin is a
bit more of a challenge. However, this chapter demonstrates that it's
entirely possible.

## Objectives for this Chapter

* Design Bitcoin Transactions using Command Line Tools
