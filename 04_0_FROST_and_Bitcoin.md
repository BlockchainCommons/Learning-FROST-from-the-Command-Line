# Chapter Four: FROST and Bitcoin

FROST has a lot of potential use cases involving cooperative action
and management: members of a FROST group can jointly make decisions in
an irrevocable way. Group governance and organizational
decision-making could both benefit.

However, another use case is likely to have even more immediate
applicability: controlling digital assets, in particular
Bitcoin. Because ZF FROST, the most mature toolset to date, is focused
on Zcash, working with Bitcoin is a bit more of a challenge. However,
this chapter demonstrates that it's entirely possible.

## Objectives for this Chapter
