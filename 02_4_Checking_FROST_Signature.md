# 2.4: Checking FROST Signatures

If you receive a FROST signature, obviously you must be able to
check it!

> :book: ***What is Required to Verify a Signature?*** Verification of
a signature can typically be accomplished with three items: the
message, the signature, and the public key (which is typically called
the "verifying key" in relation to FROST).

Following are some methodologies for verifying the ed25519 signature
you created in [§2,3](02_3_Creating_FROST_Signature.md).

## Verifying on the Command Line

Blockchain Commons has written
[`frost-verify`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/frost-verify-rust),
a Rust tool designed to verify `ed25519` and `secp256k1-tr` FROST
signatures.

You can download and install `frost-verify` as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/frost-verify-rust.git
cd frost-verify-rust
cargo install --path .
```

Verifying a signature require three elements: the message that was
signed; the public (verifying) key; and the signature. The trickiest
thing is often knowing what format is expected for each of these
files. Here's what you need when you use `frost-verify`:

* **Message:** The original (txt) message.
* **Verifying Key:** The `public-key-package.json` file generated by the ZF FROST Tools
* **Signature:** A hex version of the signature.

The last means that you need to convert the binary signature generated
by the ZF FROST Tools. This is done as follows:
```
% xxd -p -c0 board-meeting-250917.sig > board-meeting-250917.sig.hex
```

Afterward, you can use the `frost-verify` tool to verify your
signature. Here's how to verify the `ed25519` signature you created in
[§2.3: Creating a FROST Signature](02_3_Creating_FROST_Signature.md).

```
% frost-verify verify -m board-meeting-250917.txt -s board-meeting-250917.sig.hex -P public-key-package.json
✅ Signature verification: PASSED
```

If the test were not successful, you would instead see:
```
❌ Signature verification: FAILED
```

> :book: ***Is It Verify or Validate?*** [RFC
4949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949) suggests that
validate should refer to correctness and verify should refer to
truth. These are also the most common definitions in the cryptographic
world, so you verify a signature to see that it's authentic, though you
might validate that it's the right format, the right length, etc.

### Creating a Signature for Testing

The `frost-verify` program also allows for the creation of a test
signature. All you need is the file to sign and `frost-verify` will
create the signing shares, sign, and record the verifying key:

```
% frost-verify test-sign -m board-meeting-250917.txt -s board-meeting-250917.sig
```

Afterward, you can verify as usual:

```
% frost-verify verify -m board-meeting-250917.txt -s board-meeting-250917.sig -P public-key-package.json
```

This is primarily useful for testing that the tool is working if
you're having troubles verifying signatures that you made via other
means.

## Verifying on the Web

The website [cyphr.me](https://cyphr.me/ed25519_tool/ed.html) offers a
more general method for verifying ed25519 signatures, such as the one
you created in the last section.

![](images/web-ed25519-validation.jpg)

To use it:

* Choose the Algorithm as "ed25519"
* Choose Message Encoding as "hex"
* Paste the hex-encoded version of `board-meeting-250917.txt` (or any other message converted to hex) as "Message", e.g.: `446174653a20392f31372f32350a50726573656e743a20303130303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030302c20303230303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030300a0a4465636973696f6e733a0a2a20416c6c6f636174652024313020746f204a616d20696e2043656e7472616c205061726b2050617274790a2a20416c6c204d656d62657273204d75737420436f6e7472696275746520243520746f2047726f7570204b6974747920627920392f32342f32350a`
* Choose "Key Encoding" as "hex"
* Leave "Seed" blank.
* Paste the `verifying_key` from `public-key-package.json` as the "Public Key", e.g. `8f9ee5e7f2642ed8b7c4eb1c7342ecbf69e7284b07e18434e577ad580a1412ed`.
* Convert the binary signature in `board-meeting-250917.sig` (or any other signature file) to hex with `xxd -p -c0 board-meeting-250917.sig`, then paste that into "Signature", e.g.: `d558109f63f5042187daa81475895969bcc8afc48e0dca7dce31154087a65cd1740e971671d4be8a42f513561b7cb421141d8563a78d04f7f73a5bb5656c5800`.
* Click "Verify".
* You should see "Valid Signature".

## Verifying with Code

The [ZF FROST Book](https://frost.zfnd.org/tutorial/signing.html)
notes that if you use the ZF FROST crates, you can simply verify a
signature with the following code:

```
let is_signature_valid = pubkey_package
    .verifying_key()
    .verify(message, &group_signature)
    .is_ok();
```

The [ed25519_zebra
crate](https://docs.rs/ed25519-zebra/latest/ed25519_zebra/) offers a
similar solution:

```
assert!(
    VerificationKey::try_from(vk_bytes)
        .and_then(|vk| vk.verify(&sig_bytes.into(), msg))
        .is_ok()
);
```

Either code base could be used to quickly develop a verification tool
of your own.

## Summary: Checking FROST Signatures

You've now experienced the basics of FROST hands-on. You created a
FROST group in [§2.2](02_2_Creating_FROST_Secret_Shares_with_TDG.md),
created a FROST signature in [§2.3](02_3_Creating_FROST_Signature.md),
and checked a FROST signature here.

You should have a good understanding of:

* What an m-of-n FROST group is.
* How signatures are created in two rounds, with commitments, then signatures, followed by aggregation.
* How you can use a message, signature, and verifying (public) key to verify a signature.

That's the basics!

## What's Next

[Chapter 3: Advanced FROST Capabilities](03_0_Advanced_FROST.md) talks
about some advanced features of FROST, some of which are fully
supported by the modern CLI, some of which are not.
