# Chapter Two: Signing with FROST

The Zcash Foundation has created one of the most advanced developer
resources for FROST. They've created a [set of Rust
crates](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost) implementing FROST
with a variety of ciphersuites and a [set of CLI
tools](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-tools).

This chapter details how to use ZF FROST command-line tools to create
FROST secret shares and to sign with them.
