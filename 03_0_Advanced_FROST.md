# Chapter Three: Advanced FROST Capabilities

Among the more advanced capabilities of FROST are the ability to
create shares using Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and the
possibility to repair, refresh, and otherwise change shares after the
fact.

This chapter overviews these topics, though the latter is not yet
available for hands-on experimentation in the CLI.

## Objectives for this Chapter

After working through this chapter, a reader will be able to:

* Create DKG FROST Secret Shares
* Design User-Friendly DKG Interfaces

Supporting objectives include the ability to:

* Understand the Difference Between DKG and TDG
* Understand How FROST Shares Can Be Modified
* Understand the Security Ramification of FROST Reshares
