# Chapter One: Introduction to FROST

What is FROST? How does it compare to traditional multisig or secret
sharding systems? And what is Schnorr and how do the two major Schnorr
designs, FROST and MuSig2, compare?

Those are the topics of this chapter, which are intended to help
anyone, including engineers, developers, and project managers, to
understand the fundamentals of the new FROST threshold signing system.

## Objectives for this Chapter

After working through this chapter, a reader will be able to:

   * Decide to Implement FROST (or Not)

Supporting objectives include the ability to:

   * Know the Fundamental Properties of FROST
   * Understand the Process of FROST Signing
   * Understand the Differences between FROST and Other Systems
